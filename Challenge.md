# The Challenge
Build a game which tests the user on their ability to rank the popularity of songs.

**Given 3 songs from the Top 100 songs on the Billboard, prompt the user to order the songs in terms of their position on the Billboard and let them know if they were correct. Once the user is finished, let the user know how accurate they were in their guesses.**

I will build two different services, a frontend and a backend, which together complete the project.

## The Frontend
The frontend serves as the way that a user would interact with your program and play the game. Lot of flexibility in terms of how you choose to build it ranging from a simple executable (ran from the terminal) to a website, app, or any (reasonable) technology.

## The Backend
The backend consists of a RESTful API that can be accessed to retrieve song titles and artist names from the top 100 songs on the Billboard Charts with their order.
